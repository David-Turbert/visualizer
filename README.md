visualizer
==========

The visualizer is a tool developped by the cheminformatics department of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. It aims at the visualization of all sort of scientific data generated in JSON format.
The visualizer works by modules which have the task to render one specific kind of information (table, chart, values, ...) to the screen, while being able to send out event and actions to other modules through the user interaction.
Modules may be added, moved, duplicated, resized and removed. Each module can be configured with built-in options to allow customization of your visualizer page.
